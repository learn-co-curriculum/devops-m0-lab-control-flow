# Control Flow Practice

## Task

The goal of this lab is to have you become better acquainted with control flow and shell scripting in general.

The lab contains 4 scripts:

- `if.sh`
- `for.sh`
- `while.sh`
- `case.sh`

Each is intended to test one of the major forms of control flow, and contains some included code and comments explaining what it is supposed to do. Your job is to complete them; simply clone this lab and get started!
